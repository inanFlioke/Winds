Wrestling Spirit 3 is a game that requires strategy, creativity, and patience. Here are some tips and tricks to help you succeed in your wrestling career:
 
- Choose your character wisely. You can create your own wrestler or use one of the existing ones. Each wrestler has different attributes, skills, moves, and styles. You should pick a wrestler that suits your preferred way of wrestling, whether it's technical, brawling, high-flying, or something else.
- Train regularly. You can improve your character's attributes and skills by training in different areas, such as strength, speed, stamina, charisma, psychology, and more. Training also helps you prevent injuries and maintain your morale. However, you should also balance your training with rest and recovery, as overtraining can lead to fatigue and injury.
- Plan your matches. Before each match, you can choose your strategy, such as how aggressive you want to be, what body part you want to target, what moves you want to use, and how much you want to interact with the crowd. You should also study your opponent's strengths and weaknesses, and adapt your strategy accordingly. You can also change your strategy during the match if things are not going well.
- Use psychology. Psychology is an important aspect of wrestling that affects how the crowd reacts to your matches and how much money you make. You can use psychology to build up anticipation, excitement, drama, and emotion in your matches. For example, you can use taunts, gestures, facial expressions, selling, storytelling, pacing, timing, and more to create a memorable match.
- Manage your career. Besides wrestling matches, you also have to deal with contracts, finances, injuries, backstage politics, rivalries, alliances, and more. You should try to negotiate the best deals for yourself, save money for the future, heal your injuries properly, avoid making enemies backstage, form alliances with other wrestlers or promoters, and create feuds that draw attention and money.

Wrestling Spirit 3 is a game that offers a lot of challenge and fun for wrestling fans. If you follow these tips and tricks, you will have a better chance of becoming a successful pro wrestler.
