The movie is set after the events of X-Men: The Last Stand, where Logan has killed his love interest Jean Grey to stop her from becoming the destructive Phoenix. Logan is haunted by nightmares of Jean and lives as a recluse in the Canadian wilderness. He is approached by Yukio, a mutant who can foresee people's deaths, who works for Yashida, a dying Japanese businessman and former soldier who Logan saved from the atomic bombing of Nagasaki in 1945.
 
Yashida offers to transfer Logan's healing factor to himself, as a way of thanking him and freeing him from his immortality. Logan refuses, but is attacked by Yashida's son Shingen and his ninjas. He is saved by Yashida's granddaughter Mariko, who is the heir to his empire. Logan and Mariko go on the run from Yakuza assassins who want to kidnap her and force her to marry Noburo, a corrupt politician allied with Shingen.
 
Logan discovers that his healing factor is suppressed by a device implanted in his body by Viper, a mutant who works for Yashida. He also learns that Yashida is not dead, but has faked his death and transferred his consciousness to a giant robotic suit of armor called the Silver Samurai. Yashida plans to use the suit's adamantium blades to extract Logan's healing factor and become immortal. Logan fights Yashida with the help of Yukio and Mariko, who kills Shingen for betraying her grandfather. Logan manages to destroy the suit and kill Yashida, but loses his adamantium claws in the process.
 
Logan returns to his normal life, but is visited by Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr, who warn him of a new threat to mutants and ask for his help.
